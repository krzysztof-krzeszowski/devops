A collection of different terraform materials mostly based on online tutorials.

The examples assume that you have AWS credentials stored in `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Another file is the config file `~/.aws/config`

```
[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

Adjust the contents of both files accordigly.
